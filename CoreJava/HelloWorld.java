//Introduction Of Java
/*Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.
It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.*/

//What is Java used for?
//
//It is used for developing Android Apps
//Helps you to create Enterprise Software
//Wide range of Mobile java Applications
//Scientific Computing Applications
//Use for Big Data Analytics
//Java Programming of Hardware devices


//History of java

//The Java language was initially called OAK.
//Originally, it was developed for handling portable devices and set-top boxes. Oak was a massive failure.
//In 1995, Sun changed the name to “Java” and modified the language to take advantage of the burgeoning www (World Wide Web) development business.
//Later, in 2009, Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems and took ownership of three key Sun software assets: Java, MySQL, and Solaris.


//Feature of Java

//It is one of the easy-to-use programming languages to learn.
//Write code once and run it on almost any computing platform.
//Java is platform-independent. Some programs developed in one machine can be executed in another machine.
//It is designed for building object-oriented applications.
//It is a multithreaded language with automatic memory management.
//It is created for the distributed environment of the Internet.

//(1)Simple

//Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand.


//(2)Object-oriented

//Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is an object.
//Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporate both data and behavior.


//(3)Platform Independent

//Java is platform independent because it is different from other languages like C, C++, etc. which are compiled into platform specific machines while Java is a write once, run anywhere language.
//A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs


//(4)Secured

//Java is best known for its security. With Java, we can develop virus-free systems. Java is secured because:
//No explicit pointer


//(5)Robust

//The English mining of Robust is strong. Java is robust because:
//It uses strong memory management.
//There is a lack of pointers that avoids security problems.
//Java provides automatic garbage collection which runs on the Java Virtual Machine to get rid of objects which are not being used by a Java application anymore.
//There are exception handling and the type checking mechanism in Java. All these points make Java robust.


//(6)Portable

//Java is portable because it facilitates you to carry the Java bytecode to any platform.
//It doesn't require any implementation.

//(7)Distributed

//Java is distributed because it facilitates users to create distributed applications in Java.
//This feature of Java makes us able to access files by calling the methods from any machine on the internet.

//(8)Multi-threaded

//A thread is like a separate program, executing concurrently.
//We can write Java programs that deal with many tasks at once by defining multiple threads.


//(9)Architecture-neutral
//Java is architecture neutral because there are no implementation dependent features, for example, the size of primitive types is fixed.
//In C programming, int data type occupies 2 bytes of memory for 32-bit architecture and 4 bytes of memory for 64-bit architecture. 
//However, it occupies 4 bytes of memory for both 32 and 64-bit architectures in Java.
